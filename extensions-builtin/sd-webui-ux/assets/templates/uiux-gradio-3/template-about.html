                    Anapnoe UI-UX Core framework leverages a custom-made visual editor and a cutting-edge component
                    library
                    to facilitate the rapid development of sophisticated Gradio applications.
                    In addition to its visually appealing design and well-planned layout, this extension
                    offers several performance enhancements to both the

                    and the
                    <a target="_blank" href="https://gradio.app">Gradio</a>
                    framework. These optimizations include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Streamline the backend by removing redundant checkpoints and “Extra Networks” (Textual Inversion, Lora, and Hypernetworks) from img2img to reduce duplicate images and event listeners.</li>
                    <li>Eliminate inline event listeners for “Extra Networks” cards and action buttons in the backend to enhance code maintainability and performance.</li>
                    <li>Implement an event delegation pattern to optimize code efficiency by consolidating event handling for “Extra Networks” cards and action buttons.</li>
                    <li>Replace all default Gradio stylesheets in the DOM with an optimized version to improve visual consistency across components.</li>
                    <li>Remove inline styles and Svelte classes from the DOM to declutter and enhance performance.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    The current optimizations significantly reduce DOM memory usage and improve loading speed.

                    Nevertheless, there is still potential for further enhancements, which will be explored in
